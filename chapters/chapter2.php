    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
    <div></p>
      Ten years have passed. Harry is now almost eleven and living in
      wretchedness in a cupboard under the stairs in the Dursley house. He is
      tormented by the Dursleys’ son, Dudley, a spoiled and whiny boy. Harry
      is awakened one morning by his aunt, Petunia, telling him to tend to the
      bacon immediately, because it is Dudley’s birthday and everything must
      be perfect. Dudley gets upset because he has only thirty-seven presents,
      one fewer than the previous year.</p>
