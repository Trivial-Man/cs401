    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <div>
    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were 
    <strong>proud</strong> to say that they were <span class="highlight 
      red_border">perfectly</span> normal, thank you very much. They were the last 
    people you'd expect to be <span id="blue">involved</span> in anything strange or mysterious, 
    because they just didn't hold with such <span class="highlight">nonsense</span>. </p>
    <p>Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made 
    drills. He was a big, beefy man with <span id="red">hardly</span> any neck, although he did 
have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had 
nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she 
spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the 
neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their 
opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. </p>
