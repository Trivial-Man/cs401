      Character names in Harry Potter are carefully chosen not to be lifelike but rather to color our understanding of the various charactersâ€™ social ranks and personalities. This technique, which the nineteenth-century English author Charles Dickens used prolifically in such novels as Great Expectations and A Tale of Two Cities, is closer to caricature than to realism and gives each character a larger-than-life, mythical feel.
